# 🌿 adaptanatasa

**Welcome to my digital universe — a place where technology, knowledge, and a holistic approach to life meet, supporting informed decisions and the activation of our full human potential.**

This hub has two purposes:  
• To freely share my work for your personal growth and empowerment  
• To attract meaningful collaborations (I'm very selective) to co-create a better future for all

I am **Nataša Mihajlović** – INFJ, Integrator, author, educator, and MSc in Informatics with a passion for open source, computational intelligence, bash scripting, DevOps/MLOps, Linux, and the synergy between technology and creativity.  
I deeply believe in the union of science and art. I love creating real-life inspired learning scenarios that help explain complex concepts to anyone willing to read mindfully and work bravely in the terminal.  
The books I publish invite introspection and action — for both personal development and the use of information technologies.

## 📚 What you will find here

- **My published books**  
  I am a registered author/publisher. My books have ISBNs and are freely available for download and reading.  
  I believe in co-creativity: my works continue to live and create new value through the reader — I do not interfere in that process.

- **Self-study practice guides**  
  Bash scripting, networking, Linux administration (all distros), DevOps (vanilla K8s, OpenShift, Tanzu), MLOps, SRE...  
  Everything is done through the terminal, and guides are full of real explanations — not for sale, but for open sharing.  
  This is my heartfelt gift to the open-source community and my geek soul that deeply connects with logical machines and the brilliant humans who love them.

- **Code for my static websites**  
  - `zzuridigital.com`: Organization for human adaptation to computational intelligence
